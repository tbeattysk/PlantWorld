# Plant World

The [PlantWorld.ino](PlantWorld.ino) arduino code, was designed to provide our "Plant World" project with 6 seperate states, including 3 transitional states, that respond to outside world sensor data, to direct the behavior of two servo controlled motor mechanisms (a winch operated tall tree and a cam shaft operated forest of trees.)
